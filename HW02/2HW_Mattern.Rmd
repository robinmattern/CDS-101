2. Another useful dplyr filtering helper is `between()`. What does it do? It simplifies filtering data between two given values. Instead of having to write two separate conditions, such as x > lower value and x < higher value, you can instead write, between(x, lower value, higher value). For example:

There are 8,255 flights with missing departure times. They also having missing departure delay, arrival, and arrival delay times. These rows may account for cancelled flights.

Can you figure out the general rule? Because when working with an unknown variable like NA, you can look at the general rule without having to know its contents.

### 5.4.1 Exercises

1.  Brainstorm as many ways as possible to select "dep_time", "dep_delay", "arr_time", and "arr_delay" from "flights."
```{r}
select(flights, dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, arr_delay)
```
```{r}
select(flights, dep_time:arr_delay, -(sched_dep_time), -(sched_arr_time))
```
```{r}
select(flights, starts_with("dep"), starts_with("arr"))
```
```{r}
select(flights, ends_with("delay"), ends_with("time"), -(starts_with("sched")), -(air_time))
```

2.  What happens if you include the name of a variable multiple times in a "select()" call?
It still produces a table with the variable without error. 
```{r}
select(flights, distance, distance)
```
  
3.  What does the "one_of()" function do? Why might it be helpful in conjunction with this vector? The "one_of()" function allows you to select data from a preset vector.

select(flights, one_of(vars))
```

4.  Does the result of running the following code surprise you?  How do the select helpers deal with case by default? How can you change that default? No, the results do not suprise me because the "contains()" function worked exactly it should, by choosing variables that contain the text, "time". The select helper ignores case, treating "TIME", "Time", and "time" equally. I could change this by adding, "ignore,case = FALSE".

```{r}
select(flights, contains("TIME"))
```

### 5.5.2 Exercises

1. Currently "dep_time" and "sched_dep_time" are convenient to look at, but hard to compute with because theyâ€™re not really continuous numbers. Convert them to a more convenient representation of number of minutes since midnight.
```{r}
<<<<<<< HEAD
dep_time_broken <- transmute(flights, dep_time, 
          hour = dep_time %/% 100, 
          minute = dep_time %% 100) 
mutate(dep_time_broken, hour * 60 + minute)
```
```{r}
sched_dep_time_broken <- transmute(flights, sched_dep_time, 
          hour = sched_dep_time %/% 100, 
          minute = sched_dep_time %% 100) 
mutate(sched_dep_time_broken, hour * 60 + minute)
```


2. Compare "air_time" and "arr_time - dep_time". What do you expect to see? I expect to see the same values in both cases. 
=======
dep_time_broken <- transmute(flights, dep_time,
          hour = dep_time %/% 100,
          minute = dep_time %% 100)
mutate(dep_time_broken, hour * 60 + minute)
```
```{r}

sched_dep_time_broken <- transmute(flights, sched_dep_time,
          hour = sched_dep_time %/% 100,
          minute = sched_dep_time %% 100)

```

```{r}
flights_updated <- mutate(flights, difference = arr_time - dep_time)
select(flights_updated, air_time, difference)
```
<<<<<<< HEAD

What do you see? They are different. What do you need to do to fix it? I need to change it to the continuous representation of numbers as in the last question. 
```{r}
dep_time_broken <- transmute(flights, dep_time, 
          hour = dep_time %/% 100, 
          minute = dep_time %% 100) 
mutate(dep_time_broken, hour * 60 + minute)

arr_time_broken <- transmute(flights, arr_time, 
          hour = arr_time%/% 100,
          minute = dep_time %% 100)

How would you expect those three numbers to be related? I would expect "dep_delay" to be the difference between "sched_dept_time" and "dep_time".
